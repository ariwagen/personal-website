    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm the founder and COO of <a href="https://rowansci.com/">Rowan</a>. At
      Rowan, we're accelerating molecular simulation with ML and building tools
      to help chemists harness those simulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting Rowan, I attended Northeastern. I post on
      <a href="https://ariwagen.substack.com/">Substack</a> and
      <a href="https://x.com/ariwagen">Twitter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>NNP Arena</h2>
    <p>
      Neural network potentials are ML models used to approximate solution of
      the Schr√∂dinger equation, which describes how systems of atoms will behave
      with quantum accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With help, I maintain <a href="/nnp-arena">NNP arena</a>, a
      <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">LMSYS</a>-style leaderboard of NNP
      benchmarks, as well as lists of open-source
      <a href="/nnp-datasets">datasets</a> and
      <a href="/nnp-architectures">architectures</a> for training NNPs.
